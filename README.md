# Bre Ramjit's Portfolio
## Creating My Web Portfolio:
To start, I created a mockup of the website I wanted to code using Adobe XD. I considered pages such as a home page, about page, and portfolio page. While creating the mockup, I used grids to ensure that when coding, I would be aware of what my margins are. To bring my web portfolio to life, I started with the HTML using proper organization and syntax. Once the HTML was finished, I resized all of the images being used for mobile and desktop view. Resizing was done using Photoshop. Once I inputted all the images, I moved onto working on the CSS. I re-used the same navigation bar and footer that I used for my midterm assignment, therefore those sections were pretty easy to style. While styling, I had my XD mockups opened on a different monitor to simplify measuring the px of space between paragraphs and images. 
## Challenges I Faced:
Since I re-used the navigation bar and footer from my midterm assignment I did not have much challenges this time around as those were the most difficult aspects for me to style while wokring on the midterm. I had originally used a different footer layout however I could not figure out how to style it so I moved all of the text to the center, and I do not mind how it turned out. Using flex has never been my strong suit so when styling the navigation bar I found re-watching lectures very helpful. Some minor challenges I experienced were forgetting to link the navigation tabs on all pages so sometimes when I viewed my portfolio in a live server, some links did not work - but that was an easy fix. 
## What I Learned: 
The most important feedback I recieved from my midterm submission was ensuring I link my logo back to my homepage. That is something I did not consider before, but it is something I did for my portfolio, and something I will always do in the future. I did not know how to add a link to an image so I used external resources to do so. The most important thing I learned about coding all along is that it consists of a lot of trial and error. While coding I always had my live server opened to see the changes I made in real time to determine wether I liked it or not.
